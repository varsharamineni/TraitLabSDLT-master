function[ x_tminus ] = catastropheMeans(L, x_s, T, tr, loc, K, borPars)
% Function to compute the pattern means as a result of a catastrophe on
% lineage loc (counting from right to left).
% Takes the same inputs as patternMeans with the addition of loc:
%  -- L: number of lineages
%  -- x_s: vector of initial expected pattern frequencies
%  -- T: length of interval
%  -- tr: rate parameters
%  -- loc: catastrophe branch
%  -- K: offset leaves on interval, if any
%  -- borPars: parameters of ODEs, etc.
% Outputs pattern means at the end of the catastrophe period, which is
% a period of virtual time during which deaths on and borrowings in to
% loc occur.

% We find pairs of patterns which differ by one at location loc then form
% the corresponding rate matrix. We generate the pairs of patterns instead
% of finding them.

% K lists the indices of branches which have died. Dead branches don't
% affect which patterns get paired up during a catastrophe (due to the fact
% that paired patterns only differ at the index corresponding to the
% catastrophe branch. We alter the borrowing rates between patterns during
% a catastrophe by the number of extant branches and evolving traits in the
% source pattern.

% Updated by LJK on 20/11/2014 to use a for-loop and the explicit solution
% of 2 x 2  ODEs rather than one large system of ODEs and ODE solver.

% Number of patterns.

% Generating the indices of patterns which only differ by their entry on
% the catastrophe branch.
